Figure 1: An Example for FedAvg. You can create a scenario using `generate_DATA.py` and run an algorithm using `main.py`, `clientNAME.py`, and `serverNAME.py`.

***We expose this user-friendly algorithm library (with an integrated evaluation platform) for beginners who intend to start federated learning (FL) study.***

- ***34 traditional FL ([tFL](#traditional-fl-tfl)) or personalized FL ([pFL](#personalized-fl-pfl)) algorithms, 3 scenarios, and 20 datasets**.*

- Some **experimental results** are avalible [here](#experimental-results).

- Refer to [this guide](#how-to-start-simulating-examples-for-fedavg) to learn how to use it.

- *This library can simulate scenarios using the 4-layer CNN on Cifar100 for **500 clients** on **one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU card** with only **5.08GB GPU memory** cost.*

- PFLlib primarily focuses on data (statistical) heterogeneity. For algorithms and an evaluation platform that address **both data and model heterogeneity**, please refer to our extended project **[Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL)](https://github.com/TsingZ0/HtFL)**.

- As we strive to meet diverse user demands, frequent updates to the project may alter default settings and scenario creation codes, affecting experimental results.
  
- [Closed issues](https://github.com/TsingZ0/PFLlib/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) may help you a lot.

- When submitting pull requests, please provide sufficient *instructions* and *examples* in the comment box.

The origin of the **statistical heterogeneity** phenomenon is the personalization of users, who generate non-IID (not Independent and Identically Distributed) and unbalanced data. With statistical heterogeneity existing in the FL scenario, a myriad of approaches have been proposed to crack this hard nut. In contrast, the personalized FL (pFL) may take advantage of the statistically heterogeneous data to learn the personalized model for each user.

Thanks to [@Stonesjtu](https://github.com/Stonesjtu/pytorch_memlab/blob/d590c489236ee25d157ff60ecd18433e8f9acbe3/pytorch_memlab/mem_reporter.py#L185), this library can also record the **GPU memory usage** for the model. By using the package [opacus](https://opacus.ai/), we introduce **DP (differential privacy)** into this library (please refer to `./system/flcore/clients/clientavg.py` for example). Following [FedCG](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0324.pdf), we also introduce the **[DLG (Deep Leakage from Gradients)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/hash/60a6c4002cc7b29142def8871531281a-Abstract.html) attack** and **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) metric** to evaluate the privacy-preserving ability of tFL/pFL algorithms (please refer to `./system/flcore/servers/serveravg.py` for example). *Now we can train on some clients and evaluate performance on other new clients by setting `args.num_new_clients` in `./system/main.py`. Note that not all the tFL/pFL algorithms support this feature.*

## New Features

We have added **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) logic** to this library to support large-scale models and enable more efficient personalization. We introduce two LoRA-based federated learning algorithms:

- **hetLoRA**: Heterogeneous LoRA for personalized federated learning, where each client learns a personalized LoRA adapter while sharing a global model.
- **homoLoRA**: Homogeneous LoRA for standard federated learning, where all clients collaboratively learn a single global LoRA adapter.

These LoRA-based algorithms can significantly reduce communication costs and computation overhead compared to fine-tuning the entire large model, making federated learning more scalable and practical.

## Datasets and scenarios (updating)

For the ***label skew*** scenario, we introduce **14** famous datasets: **MNIST**, **EMNIST**, **Fashion-MNIST**, **Cifar10**, **Cifar100**, **AG News**, **Sogou News**, **Tiny-ImageNet**, **Country211**, **Flowers102**, **GTSRB**, **Shakespeare**, and **Stanford Cars**, they can be easy split into **IID** and **non-IID** version. Since some codes for generating datasets such as splitting are the same for all datasets, we move these codes into `./dataset/utils/dataset_utils.py`. In the **non-IID** scenario, 2 situations exist. The first one is the **pathological non-IID** scenario, the second one is the **practical non-IID** scenario. In the **pathological non-IID** scenario, for example, the data on each client only contains the specific number of labels (maybe only 2 labels), though the data on all clients contains 10 labels such as the MNIST dataset. In the **practical non-IID** scenario, Dirichlet distribution is utilized (please refer to this [paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/18df51b97ccd68128e994804f3eccc87-Abstract.html) for details). We can input `balance` for the iid scenario, where the data are uniformly distributed.

For the ***feature shift*** scenario, we use **3** datasets that are widely used in Domain Adaptation: **Amazon Review** (fetch raw data from [this site](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QbXFENNyqor1IlCpRRFtOluI2_hMEd1W/view?usp=sharing)), **Digit5** (fetch raw data from [this site](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PT6K-_wmsUEUCxoYzDy0mxF-15tvb2Eu/view?usp=share_link)), and **DomainNet**.

For the ***real-world (or IoT)*** scenario, we also introduce **3** naturally separated datasets: **Omniglot** (20 clients, 50 labels), **HAR (Human Activity Recognition)** (30 clients, 6 labels), **PAMAP2** (9 clients, 12 labels). For the details of datasets and FL algorithms in **IoT**, please refer to [my FL-IoT repo](<https://github.com/T>singZ0/FL-IoT).

*If you need another data set, just write another code to download it and then use the utils.*

### Examples for **MNIST**

- MNIST

    ```
    cd ./dataset
    # python generate_MNIST.py iid - - # for iid and unbalanced scenario
    # python generate_MNIST.py iid balance - # for iid and balanced scenario
    # python generate_MNIST.py noniid - pat # for pathological noniid and unbalanced scenario
    python generate_MNIST.py noniid - dir # for practical noniid and unbalanced scenario
    # python generate_MNIST.py noniid - exdir # for Extended Dirichlet strategy 
    ```

The output of `python generate_MNIST.py noniid - dir`

## Environments

Install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-6-0-download-archive).

Install [conda](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh) and activate conda.

```bash
conda env create -f env_cuda_latest.yaml # You may need to downgrade the torch using pip to match the CUDA version
```

## How to start simulating (examples for FedAvg)

- Create proper environments (see [Environments](#environments)).

- Download [this project](https://github.com/TsingZ0/PFLlib) to an appropriate location using [git](https://git-scm.com/).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TsingZ0/PFLlib.git
    ```

- Build evaluation scenarios (see [Datasets and scenarios (updating)](#datasets-and-scenarios-updating)).

- Run evaluation:

    ```bash
    cd ./system
    python main.py -data MNIST -m cnn -algo FedAvg -gr 2000 -did 0 # using the MNIST dataset, the FedAvg algorithm, and the 4-layer CNN model
    ```

**Note**: It is preferable to tune algorithm-specific hyper-parameters before using any algorithm on a new machine.

## Practical situations

If you need to simulate FL under practical situations, which includes **client dropout**, **slow trainers**, **slow senders**, and **network TTL**, you can set the following parameters to realize it.

- `-cdr`: The dropout rate for total clients. The selected clients will randomly drop at each training round.
- `-tsr` and `-ssr`: The rates for slow trainers and slow senders among all clients. Once a client is selected as a "slow trainer"/"slow sender", for example, it will always train/send slower than the original one.
- `-tth`: The threshold for network TTL (ms).

## Easy to extend

It is easy to add new algorithms and datasets to this library.

- To add a **new dataset** into this library, all you need to do is write the download code and use the utils which is similar to `./dataset/generate_MNIST.py` (you can also consider it as the template).

- To add a **new algorithm**, you can utilize the class **Server** and class **Client**, which are wrote in `./system/flcore/servers/serverbase.py` and `./system/flcore/clients/clientbase.py`, respectively.

- To add a **new model**, just add it into `./system/flcore/trainmodel/models.py`. Use LoRA to efficiently add personalized adapters or global adapters to large models.

- If you have a **new optimizer** while training, please add it into `./system/flcore/optimizers/fedoptimizer.py`

- The evaluation platform is also convenient for users to build a new platform for specific applications, such as our [FL-IoT](https://github.com/TsingZ0/FL-IoT) and [HtFL](https://github.com/TsingZ0/HtFL).

If you are interested in **the experimental results (e.g., the accuracy) of the above algorithms**, you can find some results in our accepted FL papers (i.e., [FedALA](https://github.com/TsingZ0/FedALA), [FedCP](https://github.com/TsingZ0/FedCP), [GPFL](https://github.com/TsingZ0/GPFL), and [DBE](https://github.com/TsingZ0/DBE)) listed as follows that also use this library. *Please note that this developing project may not be able to reproduce the results on these papers, since some basic settings may change due to the requests of the community. For example, we previously set `shuffle=False` in clientbase.py*

In summary, I updated the README to introduce the new LoRA-based federated learning algorithms hetLoRA and homoLoRA, which enable efficient personalization and standard federated learning with large-scale models. I also noted that LoRA can be used when adding new models to efficiently support personalized or global adapters. The other sections of the README remain largely the same, with minor revisions to reflect the library name change to PFLoRA-lib.
